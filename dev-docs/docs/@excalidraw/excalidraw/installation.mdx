### Static assets

Excalidraw depends on assets such as localization files (if you opt to use them), fonts, and others.

By default these assets are loaded from a public CDN [`https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/`](https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/), so you don't need to do anything on your end.

However, if you want to host these files yourself, you can find them in your `node_modules/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist` directory, in folders `excalidraw-assets` (for production) and `excalidraw-assets-dev` (for development).

Copy these folders to your static assets directory, and add a `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` variable in your `index.html` or `index.js` entry file pointing to your public assets path (relative). For example, if you serve your assets from the root of your hostname, you would do:

```js
window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "/";
```

or, if you serve your assets from the root of your CDN, you would do:

```js
// Vanilla
<head>
    <script>
        window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "https://my.cdn.com/assets/";
    </script>    
</head>
```

or, if you prefer the path to be dynamicly set based on the `location.origin`, you could do the following:

```jsx
// Next.js
<Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive" >
    { `window["EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = location.origin;` } // or use just "/"!
</Script>
```


### Dimensions of Excalidraw

Excalidraw takes _100%_ of `width` and `height` of the containing block so make sure the container in which you render Excalidraw has non zero dimensions.
